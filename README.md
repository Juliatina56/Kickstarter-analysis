			Kickstarting with Excel
#Purpose
	The purpose of this project was to help Louise compare her different campaigns based on their launch date and funding goals. We did this using different type of charts, graphs, and formulas in excel. 
## Analysis and challenges 
	I was able to analyze outcome based on the parent category and outcomes based on launch dates. One challenge I ran into was creating the graph for outcomes based on launch date. Every time I put the data into the pivot chart inaccurate information would show. It was very frustrating and later I learned that the reason inaccurate information was showing was because when I was highlighting the tabs the whole entire column would highlight. This means that even blank columns were highlighted and was part of the data I was trying to analyze which caused the numbers to be off. This challenge made me realize that you must take your time when creating charts or doing anything with data. It also made showed me that one little mistake or one little thing you overlook can have a big impact on your results and cause errors.
###Results
	Two conclusions I can make about theater outcomes based on launch date is May has the most successful outcome. Another conclusion I can make about this data is that number “canceled” number of outcomes stayed consistent during all the months. 
	For outcome based on goals I can conclude that the results were higher and even better than the pledged goal. I can also conclude that the number for failed goals is higher than the number for successful goals. 
  Some limitations to this data set are the dates and the length of dates. Some of the launch times are shorter or longer than others which can cause some of the data to be thrown off. This is because some categories had longer than others.
	A different chart that could have been used for this data set is a pie chart. It could have been filtered by different categories, different parent categories and months to show the outcomes. This is a good graph for visualization to really show how the outcomes are bigger or lower than the others.
